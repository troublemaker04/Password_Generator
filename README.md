# Password_Generator
Make a strong password based on your reference

it is a very simple password generator that uses classes to make a strong password based on the length that the user chooses.

How to use:

1. Download the code as a zip file.
If you don't have Python installed already, download and install it.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
3. Open your terminal or command-line interface.
4. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file using the cd command. For example:
cd Downloads
cd Password_Generator-main
5. Navigate into the same directory again while on that same directory: 
cd Password_Generator-main
6. Run the Python script by typing:
python pwdgen.py
7. Enter the desired password length when prompted.
Your secure password will be generated. If the password is more than 25 characters long, it will be saved as a TXT file. Otherwise, you can simply copy it.
